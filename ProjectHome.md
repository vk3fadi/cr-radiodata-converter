This program will have two functions:
  1. Export the Kenwood TS-2000 memory data to a CSV file
  1. Import data from that CSV file back to your radio

It will not save the menu settings or any other radio configuration data. For that, use MCP2000. This program is solely to import/export channel data to CSV format.

You can use this to import data to a Kenwood TS-2000 or to Export data from TS2K to another programming software for another radio.
